*USERBOT TECHNICAL ASSESSMENT

It is a simple program that allows you to count words, letters and spaces in a text file, provided from the local machine or an online resource.
Used npm packages:
	axios: to get and read the file from over the internet
	fs: to read the file from the local machine
	text-word-count: to count letters, words, and spaces in the file
	letter-count: this package allows you to count all repetitions of the same word in a file

**HOW IT WORKS:
the program takes a filePath as an argument, reads the file from the path, and returns the amount of words, letters, spaces, and words appearing more than 10 times in the file.

**HOW TO INSTALL:
if you already have node installed, just cd into the folder and type make. This will install all required packages and build the js file with tsc.

**HOW TO USE:
Once called make, just type "node analisys.js *filepath*" to get your results.
